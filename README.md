# 💼 SHLOK's Inner Portfolio

This is the inner 2D site for my interactive developer portfolio. Built with React, it's designed to mimic an operating system UI within a web experience. It runs standalone or embedded inside my 3D portfolio (hosted separately).

> Think of it as the productivity dashboard layer of my creative brain 🧠💻

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React.js** – for building responsive and dynamic UI
- **TypeScript** – strong typing for better scalability
- **CSS / Sass** – clean and modular styling
- **Framer Motion** – smooth animations
- **Vite / Webpack** – lightning-fast dev server + builds
- **React Router DOM** – for client-side routing
- **Three.js / iframe** – (for outer 3D integration)
